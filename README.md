# ARDUBLOXX

Remake of "City Bloxx"


## Gameplay

In this game, you have a plot of land at your disposal, and your challenge is to transform a small town into a thriving metropolis in just 13 days.

Upon selecting a building, you will be transported to the construction site. The lower left corner displays the number of blocks you must rebuild, while on the right, you'll see the number of blocks you can lose. If you lose all three blocks, the construction will be considered unfinished. On the right side of the window, you can track the number of inhabitants in your house.

The quality of your construction affects its stability. A poorly constructed building will sway more. Placing a block perfectly straight triggers a combo bar to appear at the top. Once it fills up completely, the message “Super combo” will appear, and you'll be credited with additional residents.

During construction, you'll contend with wind that appears at a specific height. The taller the building, the stronger the wind. Occasionally, birds may fly at a certain height, potentially colliding with your blocks and displacing them.

After 13 days of construction, you will receive a completion message. Depending on your performance, you will earn specific achievements:

| Achievement        | Task                               |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| Eagle Eye          | Combo ≥ 250                        |
| Golden Building    | Super Combo ≥ 25                   |
| Master             | Not a single block was lost         |
| Megapolis          | Population > 2000                   |
